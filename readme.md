## Getting started
The project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. For detailed installation instructions, refer to the Poetry documentation.

With Poetry installed and the repository cloned, install the project dependencies:
```
poetry install
```
This command reads the pyproject.toml file and installs all required packages in a new virtual environment (including `jupyter notebook`).
